## Why?

We are building this site to showcase our skills and attract clients. We want to build a site that is visually appealing, fully accessible (even with JavaScript disabled) and informative.

## What?

### Layout

- Full width sections in vibrant/primary colours (high contrast)
- 

### Nav
Anchor to sections:
- Jump to content button
- About
- Team
- Contact

### About
Who we are as a team and about this project

### Team
- 4 images
- Bios
- Links to projects and social profiles

### Contact
- Contact form
- MailTo link or alternative for users with JavaScript disabled

### Stretch Goals
- Create a working mobile and accessible nav that is still visually interesting
- Smooth scroll (JavaScript enabled browsers only)
- Animations in CSS
- Have a nav bar that still appears 'on scroll' in CSS
